                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheAscentLoyola/"><h2 class="section-heading">The Ascent</h2></a>

                        <p>
                            The Ascent is part of the Mid Atlantic Collegiate Climbing Series, which is a series of 6 climbing competitions for college students in the Maryland and Pennsylvania area.
                            It is hosted at Loyola University in Maryland's climbing wall and this year took place on Sunday, November 17th.

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Parking</h2>

                        <p>
                            Parking was free and right next to the gym. A little vague with lot labeling (What does "Teir 3+ even mean"?), but I don't think it was enforced on the weekends so there was no problem.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Wall and Climbs</h2>

                        <p>
                            The wall was a little small but had a fair number of climbs on it (about 40-50). There wasa  good spread in terms of difficulty, with climbs ranging from 5.5 to upper 5.12s.
                            The wall also had 3 cracks and a good amount of features and corners that made for interesting moves.

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Competition</h2>

                        <p>
                            The comp had 3 hours of open climb. Because there were only 9 ropes and a fairly good turnout, there was some waiting for ropes to open up. I didn't mind this too much,
                            as it gave me a chance to talk with other climbers and discuss beta. It did however force you to be strategic with your rest time and which climbs you wanted to get in.
                            Route points were relative to difficulty with climbs in the 5.8 range having point values in the 800s and so on. There was also a 5 point flash bonus and a 5 point deduction for each attempt.
                            I attempted all of the climbs in the 1200 range and they were all fair in their difficulty,
                            with each having a difficult crux just a few moves before the finish. This was frustrating but extremely rewarding if you could hit the moves. I only sent a few of the 1200 climbs but it was
                            enough to place me in finals.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Finals</h2>

                        <p>
                            For finals, the top 3 scoring men and women would each have 3 attempts on their respective finals route. Each finalist went one at a time, with womens before mens. Because I lead
                            in open climb score, I was to climb last, and therefore did not witness any of the other finalists climb. We were also allowed to chose a song to start climbing to.
                            The beginning of the finals climb was a simple traverse with good holds. I was a little distracted as they ended up playing the wrong song, so instead of
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveLnHzqSKM">94 Dreaming</a>, a very calm instrumental song played. This both confused and calmed me down. The climb began to ramp up
                            after the traverse, with many moves requiring smart foot placement to avoid barndooring. Before the last 3rd of the climb, I found an amazing rest spot, which gave me enough
                            energy to top the last few moves and flash the climb. Along with this, a few of the holds used in finals were used in the open climb routes, so I was already familiar with them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Topping the finals climb placed me in 1st and with that I won a flash backpack, chalk bucket, and hiking poles.
                            Emily also won first in womens and won a crash pad.
                            Overall, the comp was a great experience with good setting and a very welcoming and communal atmosphere.
                        </p>
