                        <h4>Pho</h4>

                        <span class=" text-muted">
                            Regular Bowl: $7.32 <br />
                            Large Bowl: $8.26

                        <p>
                            Cost for bowls was pretty standard. Emily and I were given a lot of meat so the value was even more worth it.

                        </p>


                        <h2 class="section-heading">Service</h2>

                        <div class="star-ratings-sprite"><span style="width:50%" class="star-ratings-sprite-rating"></span></div>

                        <p>
                            Very slow. Took over 30 minutes to get our pho, which is outrageous considering that its main ingredients are noodles (that take minutes to cook)
                            and broth, which should be ready and simmering all day anyway. I suspect that they ran out of broth when we came in, which is unfortunate for a
                            pho restaurant. I'm not sure how busy they normally are, but there was a ful house by the time we got our food, so perhaps they weren't expecting such
                            a rush on a Tuesday night (even though it was prime dinner time). Regardless, there weren't that many people in the restaurant before us, so I wonder why the slow service.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Quality of service was standard.

                        <h4>Broth</h4>
                        <div class="star-ratings-sprite"><span style="width:70%" class="star-ratings-sprite-rating"></span></div>

                        <p>
                            The broth was standard but not too strong. Emily prefered this but I prefer my broth stronger. The herbal and saltiness quickly faded
                            away after a second, leaving me with a seemingly unfulfilled after-taste, but left me wanting more. Some broths I've had hit my soul in just the right way, but this wasn't one of them.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Noodles</h4>
                        <div class="star-ratings-sprite"><span style="width:80%" class="star-ratings-sprite-rating"></span></div>

                        <p>
                            Nothing bad to say about them. Seemed like I didn't have enough but that's only because they gave me a lot of meat.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Meat</h4>

                        <p>
                            They gave me a lot of meat. I've never had my meat ratio be off because the meat side was too heavy. I ordered a tai chin nam, but I only
                            got the tai and nam in my bowl.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There was also the option to customize any combo of meats you wanted (which I like). Unfortunately I only got 2 of the 3 meats I ordered (which I Don't like).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Very soft and tasty. Wish I had more in the bowl
                        </p>

                        <div class="star-ratings-sprite"><span style="width:70%" class="star-ratings-sprite-rating"></span></div>

                        <p>
                            Had a lot in the bowl but it was kinda tendony and chewy, which I didn't really enjoy too much.

                        <p>
                            Decor was minimal and not too in your face, which I appreciated.
                        </p>

                         <p>
                             There was a strong family vibe, which is fine for some people but not my ideal setting.
                         </p>

                            Had an option for bubbles. Sweet, and reminded me of caramel.

                        <p>
                            A decent pho place with pho that is cheap and plentiful (mostly on the meat side). The service was incredibly slow but your milage may vary.
                            The staff seemed overwhelmed with the large dinner rush, and perhaps also had a lot of carry out orders as well. The restaurant was very family friendly
                            and also had many bubble tea/slushy options, which seems ideal for kids and grown ups alike.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            PS: This establishment does NOT have fall-proof spoons (with the hook on the end)
